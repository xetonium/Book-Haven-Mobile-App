    synopsis: `China's economic rise and influence has been one of the most significant developments in the global economy of recent times.

Jack Ma (Ma Yun) is one such entrepreneur. Together with his company, Alibaba, Ma has become one of the giants of the Internet world and Alibaba, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. This book presents Ma's experiences, entrepreneurial career and the whole process of Alibaba's creation.

    synopsis: `In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As first lady of the United States of America - the first African American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the US and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.
    
In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites listeners into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations - and whose story inspires us to do the same.`,

    year: '2008',
    language: 'English',
    pages: '528',
    synopsis: `By day he made thousands of dollars a minute. By night he spent it as fast as he could. From the binge that sank a 170-foot motor yacht and ran up a $700,000 hotel tab, to the wife and kids waiting at home and the fast-talking, hard-partying young stockbrokers who called him king, here, in Jordan Belfort’s own words, is the story of the ill-fated genius they called the Wolf of Wall Street. In the 1990s, Belfort became one of the most infamous kingpins in American finance: a brilliant, conniving stock-chopper who led his merry mob on a wild ride out of Wall Street and into a massive office on Long Island. It’s an extraordinary story of greed, power, and excess that no one could invent: the tale of an ordinary guy who went from hustling Italian ices to making hundreds of millions—until it all came crashing down.`,

    synopsis: `Georgia Enright has dedicated her life to dance. But at age twenty-six, her dreams of becoming a lead dancer are fleeting. Having missed college and the sweet moments of ordinary life, she ventures to Pumpkin Hill, an old farm owned by her newly found half-sister, Laura Bishop, to contemplate her future. There, discovering an affinity for the simple pleasures of country life and a barn just perfect for giving dance lessons, Georgia enjoys in oasis of peace...until Matthew Bishop shows up.

An abandoned child taken in by the same loving parents who had adopted Laura, Matt Bishop has plans of his own for that empty old barn at Pumpkin Hill—plans that include a veterinary clinic, not a ballet studio! The only thing the rugged doctor resents more than Laura's interest in her birth family the Enrights, is having to share the premises with one. Yet despite himself, he can't deny there's something special about the graceful, blonde Enright who has brightened his world—and if he's not careful, she just may find a way to dance into his heart.`,

    synopsis: `What you think shapes who you are.

If your thoughts are out of control, your life will be as well. Both the Bible and modern science provide evidence that this is true.

In recent years, a discipline of psychology called cognitive behavioral therapy has gained popularity. This discipline is rooted in an understanding that many problems--from eating disorders to relational challenges, addictions, and even some forms of depression--are rooted in negative patterns of thinking. Treating those problems begins with changing that thinking.

This has many parallels with Scripture. In Paul's letter to the Philippians, he writes about turning our thoughts to certain types of things (truth, purity, loveliness...) and putting them into practice so that we experience God's peace.`,

    synopsis: `Aladdin from “The Arabian Nights” had a magic lamp that fulfilled his every wish when rubbed. Today we have a smartphone that serves as a window to a whole universe of knowledge, entertainment and even wise personal assistants, such as Siri - all we have to do is rub the screen. Aladdin's lamp was powered by a genie, but what powers Siri?

Neural networks. It's an astounding concept that tries to mimic the way living brains work by amalgamating human and machine ways of thinking.

The goal of this book is to present the reader with a digestible, readable explanation of neural networks while keeping the underlying concepts intact. The reader will acquire fundamental knowledge of neural networks through loosely related chapters that nonetheless reference terms and ideas mentioned throughout the book.The book itself isn't meant to be strictly academic, but a blend of colloquial and technical that brings this exciting, yet eerie, topic to the widest swath of the general public. There is a lot of coding and math behind neural networks, but the reader is presumed to have no prior knowledge or interest in either, so the concepts are broken down and elaborated on as such.

Each chapter is made as standalone as possible to allow the reader to skip back and forth without getting lost, with the glossary at the very end serving as a handy summary. Where possible, references have been included to support the presented conclusions and encourage the reader to scrutinize the traditional media in search of clues.`,

    synopsis: `John Smith—Number Four—thought that things would change once he and Nine reunited with the others. But he was wrong. After facing off with the Mogadorian ruler and almost being killed, the Garde realize they are drastically unprepared. Now they're hiding out in Nine's Chicago penthouse, trying to figure out their next move.

Even with the return of an old ally, these superpowered teens aren't strong enough yet to take on an entire army. To defeat their enemy, the Garde must master their Legacies and learn to work together as a team. And when they receive a sign from Number Five—the last missing member of the Garde—they know they are close to all being together finally. But could it be a trap? Time is running out, and the only thing they know for certain is that they have to get to Five before the Mogs do.
